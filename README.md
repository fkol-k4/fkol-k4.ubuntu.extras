================

Custom settings files and various scripts for my own Ubuntu installations.

There are some prerequisites:
- Ubuntu is installed on a Btrfs filesystem.
- The system resides inside a subvolume with a non-default name (default subvolume name is @)
- The main Btrfs filesystem is set for auto-mounting to /mnt/disk_name mountpoint
