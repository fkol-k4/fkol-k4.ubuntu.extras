#                   screen blanking.

#   GENERAL DPMS INFO
#   -----------------
#   The  dpms  option  allows the DPMS (Energy Star) parameters to be set.
#   The option can take up to three numerical values, or the `force'  flag
#   followed  by  a  DPMS state.
#   The  `force'  flags  forces  the server to immediately switch to the DPMS
#   state specified.  The DPMS state can be one of  `standby',  `suspend',  `off',  or
#   `on'.   When  numerical values are given, they set the inactivity period (in units
#   of seconds) before the three modes are activated.  The first value  given  is  for
#   the `standby' mode, the second is for the `suspend' mode, and the third is for the
#   `off' mode.  Setting these values implicitly enables the DPMS features.   A  value
#   of zero disables a particular mode.
